`mvn-repo-cleaner` - Maven Repository Cleaner is a utility to clean up the local 
`.m2` directory on a developer box.

As newer versions of dependent libraries appear, the old ones become obsolete 
and never get cleaned up. 
This program assists to free up some disk space by removing older versions of 
libraries downloaded to the `.m2` directory.

This can be used just by extracting `mvn-repo-cleaner.tar.gz` / `mvn-repo-cleaner.zip` 
and executing the `execute.sh` / `execute.bat` as per the environment 
to clean up all non-latest versions of the libraries in the `.m2` directory.

To attempt a `dry-run`, just execute the `simulate.sh` / `simulate.bat` 
to see the files that would be removed without actually deleting the files.
This output is also generated in the `mvn-repo-cleaner.log`.

To run with more advanced options, open the terminal and execute the jar with 
appropriate switches as provided below.

**NOTE:** When using the `--path/-p` option, the target it points to must contain a directory (or symlink) called *repository*. This might be needed when cleaning a local directory used for publishing.
